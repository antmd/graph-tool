graph-tool -- an efficient python module for analysis of graphs
===============================================================

graph-tool is an efficient python module for manipulation and
statistical analysis of graphs. It contains several general graph
measurements data structures and algorithms, such as degree or
properties distributions, degree or properties correlations,
clustering, graph filtering, graph layout, and more, as well as a
random graph generation routine. For more information and
documentation, please take a look at the website
